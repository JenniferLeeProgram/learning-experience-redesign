# Learning Experience Redesign

## Overview
System-level analysis of a legacy learning experience  
Focus on structure, learner agency, and applied skill development

## Context
Institutional course environment  
Fixed curriculum and pacing  
Instructor-led delivery model

## Existing Structure
Linear content progression  
Memorization-first instruction  
Assessment aligned to coverage rather than application

## Friction Points
Limited learner autonomy and pacing control  
Delayed feedback reduces opportunity for adjustment  
Application occurs after instruction rather than during practice

## Design Insight
Structured delivery supports completion but not transfer  
Learners progress through content without sufficient opportunities to apply skills

## Redesign Direction
Shift from content-first to practice-driven sequencing  
Introduce earlier application and feedback loops  
Support learner choice within structural constraints

## Constraints
Institutional requirements  
Fixed instructional timeline  
Limited flexibility in assessment format

## Artifacts
Annotated course structure visuals  
Design notes highlighting redesign opportunities
